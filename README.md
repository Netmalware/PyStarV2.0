# PyStarV2.0
The Software PyStar updated and fixed bugs and errors.

just try install PyStar for test configurations!

Possibles errors:

.Icon not found
.compilation failure
.register not found
.ui error (sorry, but it's impossible to fix devide to by of PyQt5 Libs)

there is only one beta system, we will change the visual and configurations in future
and turn it most dynamic.
